# Learn Storybook

Learn Storybook teaches you Storybook by building a UI from scratch. We walk through core concepts from building and testing to deployment. This tutorial is intended to get you up to speed on Storybook best practices in a fast and approachable way.

## Contribute

Contributions to Learn Storybook are encouraged! If itâ€™s something small like grammar or punctuation, open up a pull request. If itâ€™s a bigger change, [add an issue](https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/issues) for discussion.

You'll find the chapters in the [`/content`](https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/tree/master/content) directory.

We need help translating Learn Storybook to new languages. [Find out more Â»](https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/issues/3)
Traditional Chinese translation is converted from Simplified Chinese using [OpenCC](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC). Please help us correct any idiomatic errors.

If you want to add a new chapter, create an identically named file in `content/react/en` and in `content/react/es`. If you are unable to write in one of the required languages, simply add

```
---
title: "[Title-cased Filename]"
tocTitle: "[Headline on page]"
description: "[A general description of what you're learning about on this page.]"
---

Coming Soon
```

to that localized file, and a translator will assist in finishing out the PR when possible. Once the content is created, add the file name to the toc array in `gatsby-config.js`

## Example app code
